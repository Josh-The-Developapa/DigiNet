# DigiNet
Hey There ðŸ‘‹. Relatively new to Deep Learning & PyTorch, so ya. Just started out. <br/>
Implementation of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) built with PyTorch for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST database.

## Features
- Implementation of an MLP (Multi-layer perception) for image classification.
- Trained on the popular MNIST dataset.
- Easy-to-use training and evaluation scripts.
- Post-trained parameters for the MLP model in the `DigiNet.pt` file.
- Example notebook demonstrating how to use the pre-trained model for the appropriate task.
- Pre-Downloaded MNIST data in the `data` directory

## Baseline Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- torch 2.0.1
- numpy
- matplotlib
- torchvision

An extensive list of packages required for this project can be found in the `requirements.txt` file. 
Have a go at it !
